Dear Reader, 

Hi, my name is Jorge A. Lima. I go by ```
*George.*```

I've always dreamt about working on a soundstage directing motion pictures. Maybe wearing a suit on set like the late Alfred Hitchcock. All in all, many facets of my life have changed over the years. And I once did for one hot minute minus wearing the suit that is. 

In my previous background, I worked as a [filmmaker](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3147857/?ref_=fn_al_nm_2), [photographer](https://jrgl.im), and in advertising.  Still utilizing my skillset, I've emerged and pivoted my focus to a Data Science. Here I hope I can share some of my projects and storytelling through data like I once did through the lens of my camera or transforming a script onto the silver screen.

My goal is to share my failures and successes via blogging and interviewing successful data scientists, entrepreneurs, creative and business individuals via my podcast a month of Saturdays. 

Why do you ask such a different path? Well, I have a beautiful family that needs my support and has had my support over the years, and I want to position myself with a sound career, something I can grow and continue nurture. 

Things are changing rapidly within this world, and it's powered through tech. At the time of writing this alone, ```
**FANG** companies represent *16.38%* of the *S&P 500 Index.* Add in *Microsoft* and *Apple* it'll represent 21.38% ```


For once, I'd like to be on the right side of history, especially learning a new skill set in this second wave of this industrial revolution. 

My current status: I've currently finished my track studying ML Engineering, AI, and Data Science at [Lambda School.](https://lambdaschool.com/). Please fill to reach out for any work or [freelancing](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~0117a0871449af1c70/) I may be able to assist you with.

Thank you, and please [subscribe to my podcast today!](https://mailchi.mp/db9640dec7a5/a-month-of-saturdays)

Kind Regards,
**Jorge A. Lima**
